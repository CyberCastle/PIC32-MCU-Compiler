 * Function:        fractcomplex16* TwidFactorInit16 (int log2N,fractcomplex16* twidFactors,int conjFlag)
 *
 * PreCondition:    This function requires floating-point support.
 *
 * Input:          log2N       - log2(N), N complex factors
 *                 twidFactors - ptr to twiddle factors
 *                 conjFlag    - MIPS32: Generates Complex conjugates by default.Hence this flag
 *                              is not used. It is defined to maintain compatibility with C30.

 * Output:          twidfact returned
 *
 * Side Effects:    None
 *
 * Overview:        Initialize twiddle factors
 *
 * Note:            None
