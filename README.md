# Compiler for PIC32M(K, M, X, Z) devices

This compiler is based in Microchip XC32 v2.40 [source code](https://www.microchip.com/development-tools/pic-and-dspic-downloads-archive) and ChipKIT compiler ([Branch microchip_update_20200307](https://github.com/chipKIT32/chipKIT-cxx/tree/feature/microchip_update_20200307/src48x])).

For now, only macOS Mojave and Catalina are supported in the build script.
